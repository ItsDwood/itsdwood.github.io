    "\n",
    "*The knowledge we'll develop in CSCI 0451 can be broadly divided into four main areas:*\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Theory***: *mathematical descriptions of frameworks and algorithms.*\n",
    "- ***Implementation***: *effective coding and use of tools in order to implement efficient machine learning algorithms.*\n",
    "- ***Experimentation***: *performing experiments to assess the performance of algorithms and clearly communicating about the results.*\n",
    "- ***Social responsibility***: *critical analysis of sources of bias and harm in machine learning algorithms; theoretical formulations of fairness and bias*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Every student should grow toward each of these areas, but you can choose to specialize if you'd like! If there are one or two of these categories on which you'd especially like to focus, list them below. Feel free to include any details that you'd like -- this can help me tailor the course content to your interests.*"

    "\n",
    "I want to know *why* things work, not just \"They work, and here is how to use them\". Throughout my college experience I oftentimes found myself just *doing* the motions and I really want to try to emphasize fully grasping the material. \n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of relevance to my future, I want to join a quantitative firm in the future, in order to research further in the field and develop systems that work efficiently in the market. Being an Economics and Computer Science Major, my interest lies in both and looking forward, this path seems to be the most interesting to me. That being said, machine learning is a huge component of that job field and so I want to be adept in my learnings/experimentations in the course so that I can use some of what I learned in real-world applications."

    "*Most blog posts will require around 5-8 hours on average to complete, plus time for revisions in response to feedback. Blog posts will most frequently involve a mix of mathematical problem-solving, coding, experimentation, and written discussion. Some blog posts will ask you to critically discuss recent readings in an essay-like format.*"

    "\n",
    "That is my current goal, however I do realize I am taking five courses, three of which are computer science courses, so I acknowledge that there will be times in which I have too much on my plate in order to complete every one. Still, I hope to at least keep this mentality throughout the course of the semester and do the best job I can."

You're expected to have prepared the warmup activity ahead of time (this means you'll need to have completed the readings as well). Each time, we'll sort into groups of 5-6 students, and one of you (randomly selected) will be responsible for presenting the activity on the whiteboard. If you're not feeling prepared to present the activity, you can \"pass\" to the next person, or ask for help along the way.*"

    "*To finish off the course, you'll complete a long-term project that showcases your interests and skills. You'll be free to propose and pursue a topic. My expectation is that most projects will move significantly beyond the content covered in class in some way: you might implement a new algorithm, study a complex data set in depth, or conduct a series of experiments related to assessing algorithmic bias in a certain class of algorithm. You'll be expected to complete this project in small groups (of your choosing), and update us at a few milestones along the way.*\n",
